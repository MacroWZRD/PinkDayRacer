# The Scream of Courage

“The Scream of Courage” is an interactive video game where players go through a course filled with obstacles to prevent you from reaching the finish line. At the same time, teaching players about the different mental health issues society faces and how different things can help relieve people of such problems. The moral of the story is that being yourself (doing the things you like doing, taking care of yourself, etc.) helps you find  and understand who you are.
